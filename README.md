# Ironman Backup

This is a GUI app that when run will generate backups on a timer. Previosly generated saves can be quickly loaded also.

## Setup

Before running the app open a cmd window and enter:

    pip install -r "C:\Path\to\requirements.txt"

This will install dependencies. After this run `Ironman GUI.pyw` and select start. If you are playing a supported game saves should be automatically copied on a default interval of five minutes.
